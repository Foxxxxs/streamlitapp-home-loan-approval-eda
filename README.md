## The Introduction

This APP is committed to showing the relationship between various aspects and whether the user can borrow according to the user's selection conditions. This app is a user page with strong interaction with users. Here's how to use it:
* The page has a sidebar for users to choose according to their own ideas, and this sidebar has three major blocks. The "Navigate" block allows the user to select different graphs (heat maps, bar charts, etc.) to show the relationship between each condition and the success of the loan, for example, clicking on the Plot_bar will show the average personal income of the male and female successful loan (in the data we collect). In the "The size of data" block, the user drags and drops the displayed line to select the cardinality of the dataset, for example, if you select 0.5, the displayed data analysis will be performed in the first half of the dataset we collected. The last block is to let the user select the condition to better query the information, for example, select "true" in "graduate", and the chart will only show the data analysis graph of the graduated population.
* The main page of the page is selected by the "Navigate" block. The "home" page is a brief introduction to the app and the publication of our dataset. The "Plot" page is a display of charts, and there are also blocks on the charts for users to select conditions, so as to show the data analysis graphs that users need in more detail. On the rest of the pages, there will be detailed questions that are of common interest to users, and users can follow the page introduction and get some data sheets.

## The Process of Development
Our team used two versions in the process of building the APP. In order to show the completeness of the team work, we will briefly introduce the two versions of our app before and after. The following is the completed version of our first version:

The following is the introduction of the second version: (The second version is the completed version of our APP, and the detailed page can be directly viewed with our APP)
The second version is an improvement over the first version, the second version has three more pages than the first version, a total of four pages, users can choose what they want to know according to the page blocks on the sidebar, which is more intuitive and clear than the first version, and we have added the result analysis of the data, which can better help users judge whether they are likely to succeed in the loan.
